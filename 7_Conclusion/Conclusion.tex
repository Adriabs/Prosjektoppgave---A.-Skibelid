The state estimation algorithm that has been developed and implemented in this thesis shows good results on data from last year. The same can be said about the implemented \gls{SLAM} system on simulation data. 

It is unfortunate that the car did not get test ready before the deadline of this thesis. However, the results shown above are very promising. The author believes that the low error in the state estimates combined with the efficient outlier removal of the frontend and low run time and error of the \gls{SLAM} algorithm will be enough to give good results on competitions this summer.
