\section{Contributions}
This thesis contributes in two ways. First of all, it adapts a nonlinear observer for estimating the odometry of an autonomous Formula Student race car. This odometry algorithm shows low error, even in the presence of side slip and varying ground-tyre friction. 

Secondly, it develops an improved data association scheme for \gls{SLAM} in a Formula Student setting, using ideas from the compatibility test method. This method effectively removes false positives without discarding uncertain detections before it is needed.
