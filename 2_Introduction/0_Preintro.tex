This thesis was written for Revolve NTNU's driverless race car Atmos. The autonomous system needed an improved odometry, estimating local changes in the pose of the race car. A better data association solution for the \gls{SLAM} system was also required, as the solution used last year did not give the desired performance. During the year different approaches to solving these two problems were looked at. For the odometry a nonlinear observer was implemented. The data association problem was solved with a compatibility test based method, with some adaptions for the specific case at hand.
