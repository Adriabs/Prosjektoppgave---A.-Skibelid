\section{SLAM}

There are not too many results to show in regards to the SLAM, as we do not get to test it on anything other than simulations until the car is ready, which is going to be some time after this project thesis is delivered. 

When simulating with false positives generated with a random Gaussian position, the frontend does not let any false positives through. This is of course not the best metric for performance, since detection systems do not really send false positives with completely random position. The ones they send are usually because of objects around the track, like walls, and will be spatially correlated. This means that the frontend will have to deal with false positives that cluster around particular areas. Detection data from last year shows that the false positives that get detected usually jump around a lot. Hopefully this means that the frontend will spawn many new hypotheses that loose confidence over time, instead of associating to the same false positive and eventually sending it to the backend. This is not possible to test at the moment unfortunately, since the data from last year is not compatible with the current system. 

The time used for each iteration of the frontend when simulating one round of the \gls{FSG} Trackdrive 2018 is shown in figure \ref{Fig:FrontendTiming}. Similarly the time used for each iteration of the backend is shown in figure \ref{Fig:BackendTiming}. 

The \gls{RMS} error of the map that the \gls{SLAM} system has with the ground truth map after simulating the same track has been recorded over many runs with different amounts of noise added to the detections. This error is plotted in figure \ref{Fig:SLAMERMS} as a function of the order of magnitude of the noise standard deviation.
